/*
 * What is a stack?
 * A stack is a linear data structure that follows LIFO(Last in first out)
 * principle.
 * Stack has one end, where as the Queue has two ends(front and rear). it
 * contains omly one pointer,top pointer, pointing to the top most element of
 * the stack.
 * in other words a stack can be defined as a container in which insertion and
 * deletion can be done from the one end known as the top of the stack.
 * 
 * Key Points:
 * its called a stack because it behaves like a real-world stack, piles of books
 * things like that.
 * 
 * A stack is a abstract data type with a pre defined capcity which means that
 * it can store the elements of a limited size.
 * 
 * it is a data structure that follows some order to insert and delete the
 * elements, and that order can be LIFO or FILO.

/*
 * Standard Stack Operations:
 * push(): When we insert an element in a stack then the operation. is known as
 * a push. if the stack is full then the overflow condition occurs.
 * 
 * pop(): When we delete an element from the stack, the operation is known as a
 * pop. if the stack is empty meaning no elements exist in the stack this state
 * is known as an underflo state
 * 
 * isEmpty(): It determinds weather the stack is empty or not
 * 
 * isFull(): It determind if the stack is full or not.
 * 
 * peek(): it returns an element at the given position
 * 
 * count(): It returns the total number of elements available in a stack
 * 
 * change(): it changes the element at the given position.
 * 
 * display(): it prints all the elements in the stack.
