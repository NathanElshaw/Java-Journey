/*
 * Linked Lists:
 * Linked list are linear data structures that include a series of connected
 * nodes. Linked list can be defined as the nodes that are randomly stored in
 * memory .
 * A node contains two parts, first the data part and second is the address
 * part.
 * the last node in a list contains a pointer to the null. After arrays LL is
 * the second most used data structure.
 * In a linked list, every link contains a connection to another link.

/*
 * Why use Linked List:
 * Linked list overcome the limitations of arrays. Here are some examples
 * 
 * The size of the array must be known in advanced before using it in a program.
 * 
 * Increasing the size of an array is a time taking process. it is almost
 * impossible to expand the size of the array at run time
 * 
 * All the elements in the array need to be contiguosly stored in memory.
 * inserting an element in the array needs shifting of all its predecessors
 * 
 * Its useful because-
 * it allocates the memory dyanmically. all the nodes of a linked list are
 * non-contiguously stored in the memory and linked together with the help of
 * pointers
 * 
 * in Linked list, size is no longer a problem since we do not need to define
 * its size at the time of declaration. Lists grow as per the programs demand
 * and limited to available memory space.

/*
 * How to declare a linked list:
 * it simple to declare an array, as it is of single type, while declaration of
 * a linked list is a bit more typical than array.
 * 
 * Linked list contain two parts and both are different types, one is a data
 * value and another is a pointer variable.
