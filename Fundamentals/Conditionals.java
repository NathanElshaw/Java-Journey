 * if(condition){
 * code to run
 * }
 * 
 * else if or elif statment:
 * similar to a if statment used to chain if statments mainly
 * else if(condition){
 * code to run
 * }
 * 
 * else statment:
 * this is ran if all the if statments run and none of the conditionals return
 * true
 * else{
 * code to run
 * }
 * 
 * switch statement:
 * if, else if, and else combined into one form for a switch takes a condition
 * as a parameter and cases can contain possible cases of that condition
 * switch(condition){
 * case(condition of condition input):code to run
 * }
 *
