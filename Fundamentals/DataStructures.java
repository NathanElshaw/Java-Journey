/*
 * Data Sctructures:
 * They are a way of storing, processing, retrieving and storing data. there are
 * different basic and advanced types of data structures and are used in amlost
 * every program
 * 
 * Classification of data structures:
 * Linear data structure:
 * Data that is arranged in sequentally or linearly, where each element is
 * attached to it previous and next adjacent elements
 * 
 * Static data sctructure:
 * Static data structure has a fixed memory, its easier access the elements in a
 * static data structure.
 * 
 * Ex: Arrays
 * 
 * Dynamic data Structure:
 * in a dynamic data structure the size is not fixed. ut can be randomly updated
 * during runtime which may be considered effcient concering the memory (space)
 * complexity of the code
 * 
 * Ex: queue, stacks
 * 
 * Non-Linear data structures:
 * Data structures that have data elements that are not places sequentially or
 * linearly are called non-linear data structures, and cannot be traversed in a
 * single run only
 * 
 * Ex: Trees and Graphs
 * 
 * Major Operations:
 * Searching,
 * Sorting
 * Insertion
 * Updation
 * Deletion
 * 
 * we use data structures because they are boost effiency, add reusablility and
 * abstraction
